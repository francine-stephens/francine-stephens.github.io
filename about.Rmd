I grew up in New Braunfels, Texas, which is located between San Antonio and Austin. Running and hiking were the main activities I developed a passion for while growing up in the Texas Hill Country. For my B.A., I studied quantitative methods in Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, where I fell in love with the city of Philadelphia. After completing my bachelorâ€™s degree, I swapped coasts to move to Palo Alto for the opportunity pursue a Ph.D. at Stanford. Post-pandemic, I moved up the peninsula to San Mateo and have enjoyed hiking and running along the Bay Trail. I completed my Ph.D. in the summer of 2023 and returned to the Texas Hill Country to be closer to family while searching for my next adventure in a data science and visualization career. 

Outside of my professional and educational background, my hobbies include mapping my run, hike, and bike routes; cooking vegan food; reading historical fiction; and avidly following the NBA.
